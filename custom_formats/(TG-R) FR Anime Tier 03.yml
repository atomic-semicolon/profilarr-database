description: '- WIP

  - Groups with no or little activity that have at some point made an interesting
  release which is either the only one available (in VOSTFR/MULTi) or still top of
  its category.

  - Groups that haven''t released much or are not well recognized. (yet)

  - Groups doing only anime that have retired (or no longer exist) and may not have
  the best quality by today''s standards.'
