name: (TG-R) 4K Remaster
description: "A remastered or mastered in 4K should give you usually the best picture\
  \ and audio currently for the movie. Both are just names to describe the best possible\
  \ current release of the movie.\nTo be clear, the final digital films on the Mastered\
  \ in 4K Blu-rays still only have the same 1920 x 1080 pixels of actual resolution\
  \ as normal Blu-rays. But the argument goes that because these full HD files were\
  \ derived from higher-resolution masters, their images will be more precise, with\
  \ better colors, less noise, and enhanced sharpness and detail. Not least because\
  \ the higher-resolution mastering process will provide more detail from the original\
  \ print for the Blu-ray masters to draw on when going through their (hopefully\u2026\
  ) frame-by-frame compression process.\nAnother important element of the Mastered\
  \ in 4K discs is that they\u2019re all mastered with \u2018x.v.YCC\u2019 color specification.\
  \ This delivers an expanded color range closer to that contained in source material."
