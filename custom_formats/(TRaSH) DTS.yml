name: (TRaSH) DTS
description: Digital Theater Sound (DTS) is a digital audio technology developed by
  DTS, Inc, which focuses on digital surround sound formats for consumer and commercial
  applications as well as theatrical purposes. Compared to the Dolby Digital standard,
  DTS uses four times less compression and digitizes audio sounds at 20 bits instead
  of 16 bits. This makes DTS-based audio richer in sound and more detailed than Dolby
  Digital-based ones.
