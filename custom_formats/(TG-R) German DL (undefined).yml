description: "This Custom Format is mainly used to fix files that are wrongly named\
  \ after import.\n- For example, suppose the filename suggests it is only German\
  \ but actually contains German and English audio.\n- It is also useful for users\
  \ who use a non-optimal file naming that does not follow suggested naming schemes\n\
  \    - example: `John Wick Kapitel 2 (2017) [2160p] [HDR] [7.1, 7.1] [ger, eng]\
