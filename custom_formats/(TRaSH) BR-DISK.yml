name: (TRaSH) BR-DISK
description: "This is a custom format to help Radarr/Sonarr recognize and ignore BR-DISK\
  \ (ISOs and Blu-ray folder structure) in addition to the standard BR-DISK quality.\n\
  !!! note\n    Depending on your renaming scheme, it could happen that Radarr will\
  \ match renamed files after they are downloaded and imported as `BR-DISK`,\n   \
  \ This is a cosmetic annoyance until we come up with another way to solve this,\n\
  \    Since this Custom Format is used not to download BR-DISK, it fulfills its purpose\
  \ as intended.\n    There are several reasons why this is happening:\n    - Blame\
  \ the often incorrectly used naming of x265 encodes.\n    - Radarr/Sonarr uses dynamic\
  \ custom formats.\n--8<-- \"includes/cf-descriptions/apply-10000.md\""
