name: (TG-S) Hybrid
description: A hybrid release means any combination of sources (video + audio) and
  not a direct encoding of a single source. Generally, you can be sure that any hybrid
  put together should be the best quality release of a particular title. However,
  not all release groups always mention that their release is a hybrid release.
