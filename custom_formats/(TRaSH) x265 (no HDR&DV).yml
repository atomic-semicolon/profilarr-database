  \ it will allow 720/1080p x265 releases if they have HDR and/or DV**\n*Since some\
  \ NF releases won't be released as 4k, this allows you to still have the DV/HDR\
  \ releases.*\nIn your quality profile use the following score for this Custom Format:\
  \ `{{ radarr['cf']['x265-no-hdrdv']['trash_scores']['default'] }}`\n??? question\
