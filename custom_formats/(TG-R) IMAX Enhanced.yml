name: (TG-R) IMAX Enhanced
description: "[From Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-imax-enhanced/)\nIMAX\
  \ Enhanced is a standard for digital releases. It features scenes shot on IMAX cameras\
  \ and produced in HDR10 DV. IMAX Enhanced releases often have a higher bitrate than\
  \ other WEB options and are encoded into various formats, including SDR conversions.\n\
  Due to the higher bitrate and implied picture quality improvement, it is recommended\
  \ that the IMAX Enhanced custom format be enabled on WEB profiles, especially for\
  \ those seeking 'The IMAX Experience'\u2014including fewer \"black bars\" or letterboxing.\n\
