  Movies Anywhere (MA) is a cloud-based digital rights locker and over-the-top streaming
  platform that allows users to stream and download purchased films, including digital
  copies redeemed from codes found in home video releases as well as digital purchases
  from participating services. Movies Anywhere is operated by The Walt Disney Company.
  The platform provides content from Walt Disney Studios, Sony Pictures, Universal
