  Disney+ Hotstar is an Indian subscription-based video-on-demand streaming service
  owned by JioStar, a joint venture between Reliance Industries, Viacom18, and Disney
  India. It offers a diverse array of content from Disney Star (formerly Star India)
  local networks, including films, television series, live sports, and original programming,
  as well as licensed content from third parties such as Showtime and Southeast Asian
  countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.) Although it primarily caters to audiences
  in India and those of Indian origin living abroad, its catalog has broad appeal.'
