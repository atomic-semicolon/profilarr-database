description: 'This will prevent grabbing UHD/4k Remux and Bluray encode releases without
  HDR Formats. - i.e., SDR WEB releases will still be allowed since 4K SDR WEB releases
  can often look better than the 1080p version due to the improved bitrate.

  !!! Danger "If you have also added [{{ radarr[''cf''][''sdr''][''name''] }}](/Radarr/Radarr-collection-of-custom-formats/#sdr)
  to your Radarr,<br>then one of them should be scored as `0` in your quality profile."'
