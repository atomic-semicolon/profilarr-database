name: (TG-R) FLAC
description: FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec, an audio format similar to
  MP3 - but lossless, meaning that the audio compressed with FLAC does not receive
  any loss in quality. This is similar to how Zip works, except with FLAC you will
  get much better compression because it is designed specifically for audio.
