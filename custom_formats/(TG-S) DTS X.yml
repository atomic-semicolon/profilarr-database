name: (TG-S) DTS X
description: "[DTS:X is an object-based audio codec](https://www.whathifi.com/advice/dtsx-what-it-how-can-you-get-it)\
  \ which aims to create a multi-dimensional sound that \u201Cmoves around you like\
  \ it would in real life\u201D.\nYou may think that sounds similar to Dolby Atmos,\
  \ and you\u2019d be right, but where DTS:X's differences lie in the required speaker\
  \ configuration. While Dolby Atmos requires adding additional overhead channels\
  \ to your 5.1 or 7.1 setup, DTS:X works with standard surround speaker setups \u2013\
  \ just like the one you might already have at home. It can support up to 32 speaker\
  \ locations and an 11.2-channel system.\nDTS:X, like other higher-quality DTS formats\
  \ (e.g. DTS-HD MA), is lossless."
