name: (TG-S) Obfuscated
description: 'Obfuscated releases are something you find on Usenet to do re-posts
  of common/popular releases.

  Several indexers that rely on auto-generating their NZB from groups by seeing things
  in the clear will suffer the fate of having those NZB DMCA''ed after time, as others
  can just see what it is and request a file takedown.

  You want indexers that get/do obfuscated releases and allow NZBs to be submitted
  directly to the NZB-indexer. Then, even thousands of days old releases still work
  fine unless someone leaks those NZBs to one of those public sites, where they can
  be requested to be taken down.

  - In general, if you''re using Usenet, **DO NOT** use this Custom Format.

  - Use this Custom Format **ONLY** if you **DO NOT** prefer Obfuscated releases.'
