name: (TG-R) Masters of Cinema
description: Masters of Cinema is a line of DVD and Blu-ray releases published through
  Eureka Entertainment. Because of the uniformly branded and spine-numbered packaging
  and the standard inclusion of booklets and analysis by recurring film historians,
  the line is often perceived as the UK equivalent of The Criterion Collection.
