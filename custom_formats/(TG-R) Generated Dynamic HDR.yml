name: (TG-R) Generated Dynamic HDR
description: "- A collection of groups known for generating their own dynamic HDR\
  \ metadata\u2014Dolby Vision and/or HDR10+.\n- This generated dynamic HDR metadata\
  \ does not come from official retail sources (discs or streaming services), so it\
  \ is usually undesirable. Because of the substantial effort needed and the almost\
  \ impossible task of reliably ensuring quality without reviewing each movie manually."
