name: (TG-S) Multi-Episode
description: '!!! danger "This CF utilizes functionality only available in Sonarr
  v4.0.2.1262 or later."

  This Custom Format will recognize multi-episode releases (e.g. episodes named with
  ''S01E01E02''), instead of single-episode or season packs, using Sonarr''s built-in
  parser. Depending on your preference, you can give it a negative or positive score
  or skip adding it altogether.'
