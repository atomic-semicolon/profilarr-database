description: '[From In Depth Cine](https://www.indepthcine.com/videos/imax)

  IMAX films are shot in tall aspect ratios, typically 1.9:1 or sometimes 1.43:1.
  Most IMAX film releases also have scenes shot at wider aspect ratios and, as a result,
  the aspect ratio will change throughout. Because they are shot on large format cameras,
  there is often less film grain present. This results in a clearer picture.'
