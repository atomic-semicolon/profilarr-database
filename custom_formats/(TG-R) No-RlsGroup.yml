description: "Some indexers stripped out the release group, which could result in\
  \ LQ groups receiving higher scores.\nFor example, many EVO releases are stripped\
  \ of the group name, so they appear as \"upgrades\" and receive a decent score if\
  \ other factors match.\n!!! warning\n    If you **DO NOT** use decent filenames\
  \ (like not adding release groups), **DO NOT** add this Custom Format unless you\
  \ want to upgrade them."
